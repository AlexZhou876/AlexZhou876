<h1> Hi, I'm Alex!</h1>

## About
I am a fourth year Business and Computer science student at the University of British Columbia who is passionate about software and curious about everything. At my current internship as a Software Engineer Intern at SAP, I work on the Partner Finder product using Vue.js and Java Spring Boot.
I enjoy the creative and problem solving aspects of programming and like to make sure that my projects are useful, whether for others or just for my own learning and enjoyment. 
I am currently seeking a full time new grad position starting summer 2024, preferring fullstack or backend software engineering roles.

## Recent Projects
 * **Meetable**, a web and mobile app which helps university students find compatible friend groups based on interests. I'm primarily involved with Nodejs, Express, Mongoose, but am also learning React. Recently we have renovated our backend with AWS Amplify and GraphQL, so I am learning those.
 * **music-editor**, a GUI-based editor for intrumental music capable of MIDI sequencing and IO
 * **n-body**, a C++ simulator and renderer for n-body gravitation implemented through different algorithms. Plan to create a web-app with server-side processing and client-side rendering.
 * **Interactive Animation Toolkit for Unity**, my project at the EML, a Unity editor extension for streamlining the animation and annotation of scenes for 3D VR educational applications.
