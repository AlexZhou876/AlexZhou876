<h1> Hi, I'm Alex!</h1>

## About
I am a second year Business and Computer science student at the University of British Columbia who is passionate about programming.
I like the creative and problem-solving aspects of programming, and like to make sure that my projects are useful, whether for others or just for my own education and enjoyment. I am currently seeking an internship for fall 2021.

## Current Projects
 * **Meetable**, a web and mobile app which helps university students find compatible friend groups based on interests. I'm primarily involved with Nodejs, Express, Mongoose, but am also learning React.
 * **music-editor**, a GUI-based editor for intrumental music capable of MIDI sequencing and IO
 * Planning a small project which will run and render an n-body simulation
